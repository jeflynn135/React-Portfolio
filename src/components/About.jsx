          <p className="my-description">
          I am a recent graduate from University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp. I have a wide range of job experience and have attended 4 different colleges in search of a career that best fits my lifestyle and passions. Coding is something that has always sparked my interest but I had never expected to love it as much as I do now. Being new to the programming world, I know I have so much more to learn but I am eager to expand my knowledge by working in the field.
