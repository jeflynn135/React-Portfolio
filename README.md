# React-Portfolio

## Goal:

To view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so they can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Description:

1) When the user loads the portfolio, they are presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
2) When the user views the header, they are presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
3) When the  user views the navigation titles, they are presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
4) When the user clicks on a navigation title, they are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
5) When the user loads the portfolio the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default
6) When the user is presented with the About Me section, they see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
7) When the user is presented with the Portfolio section, they see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
8) When the user is presented with the Contact section, they see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
9) When the user moves the cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, they receive a notification that this field is required
10) When the user enters text into the email address field, they receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
11) When the user is presented with the Resume section, they see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
12) When the user views the footer, they are presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
